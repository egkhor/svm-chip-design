# Contributing to SVM Chip Design

We welcome contributions to enhance this **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** project for chip design defect prediction! Here‚Äôs how you can help:

## Ways to Contribute
- **Datasets**: Share anonymized or synthetic chip design data (CSVs).
- **Models**: Optimize SVM hyperparameters (e.g., C, kernel) or test other algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees).
- **Visualizations**: Add plots (e.g., decision boundaries via matplotlib).
- **Code**: Improve scripts or add new features.

## How to Contribute
1. Fork: `https://github.com/egkhor/svm-chip-design`.
2. Branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`.
3. Commit: `git commit -m "Add your feature"`.
4. Push and open a pull request.
5. Join Discussions: [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/egkhor/svm-chip-design/discussions).

## Guidelines
- Document code clearly.
- Test scripts locally.
- Use synthetic data to avoid proprietary issues.

Thanks for advancing ML in chip design! üñ•Ô∏è
